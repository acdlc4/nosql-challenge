# nosql-challenge

This challenge involves the use of environments of NoSQL, PyMongo, and MongoDB.

The basis of the challenge is based on the following context:

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Exercises involved are:
- Importing of JSON data into the database (db)
- Updating the db by inserting new documents
- Querying of the db
- Modification of the db by deleting documents based on certain criteria
- Exploration of the db 


Limitations: 
- The scores for Hygiene, Structural, and ConfidenceInManagement work are defined as the higher the value, the worse the establishment is in these areas.
