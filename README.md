# nosql-challenge

This challenge involves data analysis with the use of database (db) environments in NoSQL, PyMongo, and MongoDB.

The basis of the challenge is built on the following context:

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Based on several questions by the magazine editors, the goal is to answer the following questions:
1) Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2) Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3) What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4) How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.

Exercises involved in this challenge are:
- Importing of JSON data into the db
- Updating the db by inserting new documents
- Querying of the db
- Modification of the db by deleting documents based on certain criteria
- Exploration of the db

Limitations: 
- The scores for Hygiene, Structural, and ConfidenceInManagement work are defined as the higher the value, the worse the establishment is in these areas.
